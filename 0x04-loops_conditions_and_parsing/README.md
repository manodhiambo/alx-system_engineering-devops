		Shellcheck

	.Shellcheck is a tool that will help you write proper Bash scripts.
 
	.It will make recommendations on your syntax and semantics and provide advice on 
	 edge cases that you might not have thought about.
 
	.Shellcheck is your friend! All your Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck without any error 
	 or you will not get any points on the task.
